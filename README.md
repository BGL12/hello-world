# hello-world
just another repository

hi i'm BGL12.
Thank you very much for today's experience. I got friends and teachers who were so patient in guiding me who were new to the new world. I have installed linux more than two years on my laptop now, during that time I was confused about how to understand how to use this installed laptop with linux?
the closest people have often suggested going back to windows only.
